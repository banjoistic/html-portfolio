<p>I learned photography, including darkroom work, from an early age. I've refined my technique over the years,
  and now do all my work digitally.  
</p>

<p>I started playing music as a teenager, dabbling in harmonica and guitar, finally settling on the 5-string banjo
  as my main instrument.
</p>

<p>I would like to learn web development in order to present my music and photography and, perhaps, even earn some
  money helping others display their abilities.
